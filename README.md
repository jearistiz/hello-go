# On the GO - Learning

Initially I'm following the [tutorials](https://go.dev/learn/) published on GO's website.

I will place here any information I think its useful for me (or you) for later reference.

## Some useful `go` commands

```sh
$ go mod init [your-module-sourcecode-url]
```

Enables dependency tracking of your module by creating a `go.mod` file in the project's root directory.
This file contains your code dependencies as well as a path-URL to find your code [possibly online].
